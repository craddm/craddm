### Hi there, I'm Matt 👋

I'm a Research Software Engineer at the Alan Turing Institute, UK. 
I currently work on the [Data Safe Haven](https://data-safe-haven.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), developing an open-source Trusted Research Environment for deployment to the Azure public cloud.

I was previously a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Lincoln, UK, where I taught research methods and statistics to students studying for Masters degrees in psychology using the R statistical programming language. I also conducted cognitive neuroscience research using techniques such as electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and transcranial electrical stimulation.
