### Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Software Engineer at the Alan Turing Institute, UK. 

I was previously a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Lincoln, UK, where I taught research methods and statistics to students studying for Masters degrees in psychology using the R statistical programming language. I also conducted cognitive neuroscience research using techniques such as electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and transcranial electrical stimulation.
